# user-stories-example1

As a user, I want to be able to use a cross-platform mobile app on both Android and iOS devices, so that I can access the app from any device I have.

##Must Criteria:

- The app must be compatible with both Android and iOS devices
- The app must have a consistent user interface and user experience across both platforms
- The app must have a high level of performance and stability on both platforms
- The app must have push notifications on both platforms
- The app must support both portrait and landscape orientations on both platforms

##Can Criteria:

- The app can have additional features that are specific to each platform, as long as they do not affect the app's core functionality
- The app can have a feature that allows users to switch between light and dark modes
- The app can have social media integration that allows users to share content from the app to their social media accounts
In order to create this app, we will need to have a workshop with three people to brainstorm ideas and draw out our thoughts. We will need to collaborate closely with a skilled and experienced developer who is proficient in Android and iOS app development using React Native. With their help, we can create a high-quality, structured app that meets the needs of our users and delivers a seamless experience on both platforms.
